### Leptos WGPU example

- A test implementation of a custom window handler to cleanly integrate Leptos and WGPU
- In the future, I may consider developing and publishing a custom Leptos component that explicitly handles the interfacing between WGPU and canvas elements, but idk I'm kinda strapped for time
